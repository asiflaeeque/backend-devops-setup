Backend Application CI/CD Pipeline
This repository is more than just code‚Äîit's a complete DevOps solution that automates the entire lifecycle of a backend application. From code commit to production deployment, every step is managed through a robust and reproducible pipeline.

üöÄ The Problem
In modern development, manual deployments are a major bottleneck. They introduce human error, are time-consuming, and create inconsistencies between environments. This project was built to solve these challenges by creating a reliable, automated, and scalable deployment process.

üéØ The Solution
We've implemented a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that handles continuous integration, containerization, and continuous deployment. This pipeline ensures that every code change is automatically built, tested, and deployed to a live environment without any manual intervention.

‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack
This project leverages a powerful stack of cloud-native and DevOps tools.

Languages & Frameworks:

Node.js: The core language for the backend application.

Express.js: A minimalist web framework used to build the application.

Version Control & Automation:

Git: Manages source code and version history.

GitHub: Hosts the repository and provides the platform for our automation.

GitHub Actions: The primary tool for orchestrating the CI/CD workflow.

Cloud Infrastructure & Services:

Amazon Web Services (AWS): The cloud provider for hosting all resources.

AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service): A managed Kubernetes service for running the containerized application at scale.

Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry): A private registry for securely storing Docker images.

IAM (Identity and Access Management): Provides fine-grained access control for service accounts and users.

Containerization:

Docker: Used to package the application and its dependencies into a lightweight, portable container.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

Terraform: Defines and provisions the entire AWS infrastructure, ensuring the environment is reproducible and version-controlled.

Observability:

Prometheus: A monitoring system that scrapes metrics from the Kubernetes cluster.

Grafana: A data visualization platform used to create dashboards from the Prometheus metrics, providing real-time insights into application performance and health.

üó∫Ô∏è Detailed Architecture & Workflow
The architecture of this project is a classic CI/CD pipeline, fully automated from end to end.

The Pipeline Flow
Push to main: A developer pushes new code to the main branch. This is the trigger for the entire pipeline.

GitHub Actions: The push event activates the workflow defined in .github/workflows/main.yaml.

CI Phase:

Code Checkout: The workflow checks out the latest code from the repository.

Login to ECR: The aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v2 action authenticates the workflow with ECR.

Docker Build: The Dockerfile is used to build the application image.

Docker Push: The newly built image is tagged and pushed to the ECR repository.

CD Phase:

kubectl Setup: The aws-actions/amazon-eks-setup@v2 action configures kubectl with the necessary credentials to interact with the EKS cluster.

Deployment: A kubectl rollout restart command is executed on the existing Kubernetes deployment. This command gracefully updates the running pods with the new Docker image from ECR.

Health Check: The pipeline waits for the new pods to become ready using kubectl rollout status, ensuring a zero-downtime deployment.

üíª Repository Deep Dive
Here's a breakdown of the critical files and directories that make this project work.

.github/workflows/: Contains the YAML file for the GitHub Actions pipeline.

aws/ and infra/: These directories hold the Terraform files for provisioning and managing the AWS infrastructure, including the EKS cluster.

kubernetes/: Contains the Kubernetes manifests (Deployment.yaml, Service.yaml, etc.) that define how the application runs in the cluster.

Dockerfile: This file contains the instructions for building the container image. It's carefully crafted to create a production-ready, lightweight image.

README.md: This file! It serves as the project's documentation and guide.

server.js: The main application file, which runs the Node.js server.

package.json: Manages the Node.js dependencies and scripts.
